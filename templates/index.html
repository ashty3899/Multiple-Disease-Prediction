                <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.
                    Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made
                    by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy Sometimes your
                    body doesn't make enough or any insulin or doesn't use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your
                    blood and doesn't reach your cells.
                    Symptoms of this disease are Urinating often, Feeling very thirsty, Extreme fatigue and Blurry
                    vision. </p>
